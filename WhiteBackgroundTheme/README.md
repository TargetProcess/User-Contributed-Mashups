# White background theme

This theme sets the background colour of the main board to white, and the background colour of the top menu to off-white. This is an alternative theme for those who don't like staring at the default grey all day.

When the theme is installed, the letters "WT" appear in the menu bar. Click these letters to activate the theme. When the theme is activated, these letters are bolded.
